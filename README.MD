#calBOSS
Thinkful capstone project one. 

##Introduction calBOSS is a basic caloric intake guide, counter, and nutritional research assistant.

##This app can be used to establish a simple caloric intake baseline depedning upon the user's goal, gain weight, shred weight, or sustain weight. After answering three quick questions (weight, sex, goal), the user can track food intake and will be notified when their goal is reached. The app can also be used to make food decisions using the Nutritionix api to research calorie count, serving size, and fat before choosing on a meal.
