          <h3>HOW MANY CALORIES DO I NEED EACH DAY?</h3>
          <p>Energy requirements are based on multiple factors including training frequency, type, intensity, body composition,
            size, and goals. The formulas and recommendations are not set in stone. It is important to use a multitude of
            tools to determine if you're achieving proper energy balance such as appetite, weight, mood, body fat percentage,
            and overall health.
          </p>

          <p>The human body uses about 60% of calories just to keep up with natural processes at rest. The amount of calories
            you burn at rest is termed your basal metabolic rate (BMR). The more lean muscle mass you have the higher your
            BMR. By building a leaner more muscular physique you increase your calorie burning abilities around the clock!</p>

          <p>The remainder of the energy pie is divided between activity and digestion. 30% of energy (calories) is used for
            physical activity while 10% is used in the process of digestion. This is why you can burn more calories by eating
            smaller meals more often.</p>

          <p>To determine your basal metabolic rate (BMR), aka how many calories your body burns at rest, we will need to use
            the following formula:
          </p>

          <h3>DAILY ENERGY INTAKE RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

            <p>Sedentary men and non-pregnant women: Approximately 31 calories/kg Male and non-pregnant female recreational
              athletes: Approximately 33-38 calories/kg Endurance athletes: 35-50 calories/kg depending on training Strength-trained
              athlete: 30-60 calories/kg depending on training</p>

            <h3>HOW MANY CALORIES TO BUILD MUSCLE MASS AND GAIN WEIGHT?</h2>

              <p>Athletes should increase their total caloric intake by 250-500 calories per day to gain weight. Some experts
                even recommend a 1,000 caloric increase per day. Remember to consider activity level when calculating caloric
                intake. Athletes should aim to consume the proper ratios of nutrients.</p>

              <p>Studies have indicated that the timing of protein intake may be more beneficial for building lean muscle mass
                rather than quantity since the body can only absorb about 30 grams of protein at a time. Athletes should
                consume protein and carbohydrates within the first 30-60 minutes post training since the body is in an ideal
                state to repair and build.
              </p>

              <p>Sufficient nutrient intake from clean food sources at multiple times throughout the day will provide the body
                with the fuel it needs to build lean hard muscle.</p>

              <h3>HOW MANY CALORIES TO LOSE WEIGHT?</h3>
              <p>Athletes should decrease their total caloric intake by 500 calories per day to lose 1 pound in 1 week. The
                caloric deficit can be created from additional exercise, diet, or a combination of both. Remember to consider
                activity level when calculating caloric intake. Athletes should aim to consume the proper ratios of nutrients.</p>

              <p>Just cutting calories alone may reduce the number on the scale, but losing body fat while maintaining hard
                earned lean muscle mass is a science. When trying to lose body fat and obtain a lean healthy body it's important
                to maintain training intensity. Caloric intake should not drop so low that training severely suffers, metabolism
                slows, or the body becomes catabolic.</p>

              <p>Losing weight and reducing body fat is a gradual process- for lasting results aim to lose no more than 1-2
                pounds per week through training and diet.</p>
